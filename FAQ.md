### Technical and Usage
<details> <summary>Can I run CNF Conformance without a Kubernetes cluster?</summary>
<p>

 - In simple terms, no. You need some type of Kubernetes (K8s) cluster whether it's bare metal, kind, Docker and so on to run CNF Conformance suite against your CNF.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>Does CNF Conformance have any pre-requisites or other requirements to run?</summary>
<p>

 - Yes. There are a few requirements for CNF Conformance. You can read about the requirements in the [INSTALL Guide](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/INSTALL.md#prerequisites).

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>How are points assigned for tests?</summary>
<p>

 - Points are different for each test and workload but in general terms, pass defaults to 5 and fail is a -1. See [points.yml](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/points.yml) for more details on the different points for default scoring.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>Does CNF Conformance support or run on other architectures besides amd64?</summary>
<p>

 - Not currently at this time.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>Can I run CNF Conformance on clusters currently in use?</summary>
<p>

 - Yes but it's not recommended. There is a destructive option that will test your nodes with reboots and recovery. We recommend that tests are run in an environment that is not currently used by others, typically in a test or dev environment setting.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>I ran several tests and missed the output of the results, are these lost or can I view past test results?</summary>
<p>

 - All test results are stored in the results/ directory of where you installed the CNF Conformance suite in yaml format.

</p>
</details>

<details> <summary>Why is CNF Conformance written in crystal and not in other languages like Go?</summary>
<p>

 - The short answer is Crystal fit the criteria we looked at in a language at the time which needed to run external programs/test suites and internal tests - [Taylor Carpenter](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/G019HM3K54H/user_profile/U7HCKCW90) via https://slack.cncf.io/

### Troubleshooting
<details> <summary>Running cnf-conformance says "No found config" or similiar type errors?</summary>
<p>

 - This may indicate that you are not pointing to a valid cnf-conformance.yml config file for your CNF. You may want to read or review the [CNF Conformance INSTALL](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/INSTALL.md) instructions or the [USAGE Documentation](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-conformance/blob/master/USAGE.md).
